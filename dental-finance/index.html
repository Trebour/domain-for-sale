      <h2>Practice Loans</h2>
      <p>Practice loans allow dentists to acquire, expand, or refurbish their clinics. Lenders typically assess NHS contract value, private income streams, and associate arrangements rather than standard SME lending criteria. Access tailored guidance in our <a href="/dental-finance/practice-loans.html">Practice Loans</a> section.</p>

      <h2>Business Finance & Cash Flow</h2>
      <p>Effective business finance management ensures smooth operations and supports growth. This includes working capital facilities, structured lending, and careful cash flow monitoring, particularly in practices with mixed NHS and private income. Explore detailed strategies in <a href="/dental-finance/business-finance.html">Business Finance</a>.</p>

      <h2>Insurance, Indemnity & Tax Planning</h2>
      <p>Professional indemnity, practice insurance, and tax planning are integral to financial security. Properly structured coverage protects income and assets while optimizing tax efficiency. Guidance is available in <a href="/dental-finance/insurance-tax.html">Insurance & Tax</a>.</p>

      <h2>Legal & Financial Intersections</h2>
      <p>Financial decisions in dentistry often overlap with legal considerations. Loan agreements, associate contracts, and indemnity terms must be carefully structured to avoid personal liability. Related content is available in <a href="/dental-legal/index.html">Dental Legal</a>.</p>
